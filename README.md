# rock-paper-scissors-v1
A simple rock, paper, scissors game

## About Project
Made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Live demo [here!](https://kyleisconfused.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-v1/)

## Known Issues
Nothing major (to my knowledge...). The JavaScript could be refactored to be a bit shorter, and I'd like to re-style the scoreboard somewhat.
